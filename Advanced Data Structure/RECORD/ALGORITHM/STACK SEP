Here are the separate algorithms for the three stack operations (PUSH, POP, and DISPLAY) implemented using a linked list:

---

### 1. PUSH Operation Algorithm

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a new node ptr of type struct stack.

Step 3: Read the value to be pushed (val).

Step 4: Allocate memory for the new node using malloc.

Step 5: Set the data of the node:  
   ptr->data = val.

Step 6: If the stack is empty (top == NULL), set:  
   - ptr->next = NULL  
   - top = ptr (The new node is now the top of the stack).

Step 7: Otherwise, if the stack is not empty:  
   - Set ptr->next = top (Link the new node to the previous top).  
   - Update top = ptr (The new node becomes the new top of the stack).

Step 8: Return the updated top pointer.

Step 9: End.

### 2. POP Operation Algorithm

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Check if the stack is empty (top == NULL):  
   - If the stack is empty, print “STACK UNDERFLOW” and return the current top.

Step 3: If the stack is not empty:  
   - Create a temporary pointer ptr and set ptr = top.  
   - Move the top pointer to the next node: top = top->next.

Step 4: Print the value being deleted:  
   - printf("The value being deleted is: %d", ptr->data).

Step 5: Free the memory allocated for the node: free(ptr).

Step 6: Return the updated top pointer.

Step 7: End.

---

### 3. DISPLAY Operation Algorithm

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a temporary pointer ptr and set ptr = top.

Step 3: Check if the stack is empty (top == NULL):  
   - If the stack is empty, print “STACK IS EMPTY” and return the current top.

Step 4: If the stack is not empty, traverse the stack using a while loop (ptr != NULL):  
   - Print the value of the current node: printf("%d", ptr->data).  
   - Move ptr to the next node: ptr = ptr->next.

Step 5: After all nodes are displayed, return the top pointer.

Step 6: End.

These separate algorithms detail the steps for each stack operation (push, pop, and display) when implemented using a linked list.

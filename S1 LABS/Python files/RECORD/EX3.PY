# Step 1: Start
# Step 2: Ask the user to enter a sentence
# Step 3: Convert the sentence to lowercase and split it into words
# Step 4: Create an empty dictionary to store word counts
# Step 5: For each word in the list, check if it is already in the dictionary
# Step 6: If it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1
# Step 7: Print each word and its count from the dictionary
# Step 8: Stop

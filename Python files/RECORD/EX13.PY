n = input("Enter a number: ")
n1 = n
n2 = n * 2
n3 = n * 3

result = int(n1) + int(n2) + int(n3)
print(f"{n1} + {n2} + {n3} = {result}")



# Step 1: Start
# Step 2: Read the number input from the user
# Step 3: Assign the input to n1, n2, and n3 where n2 is n multiplied by 2 and n3 is n multiplied by 3
# Step 4: Calculate the sum of n1, n2, and n3 (convert them to integers)
# Step 5: Print the result in the format "n1 + n2 + n3 = result"
# Step 6: Stop
